      <p>
        I am an artist with reaches in design, development, digital art, photography, e-poetry, and theatre. I enjoy making the web
        a more adventurous place with my code - a place of discovery, creation, and movement. I use technologies like HTML5,
        CSS3, Sass, Jekyll, JavaScript, jQuery, p5.js, and Photoshop to create my digital landscapes. I dwell in the intersection of code and art
        in an attempt to understand a sliver of this world.

        I am currently enrolled in Thinkful's Engineering Immersion program where I am building web applications using amazing technologies. I will graduate in July of 2018 and will embark on the job search. Through Thinkful, I've learned industry best practices using Node.js, MongoDB and React.
