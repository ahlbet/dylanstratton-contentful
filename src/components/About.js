      I am an artist with reaches in design, development, digital art, photography, e-poetry, and theatre. I enjoy making the web
      a more adventurous place with my code - a place of discovery, creation, and movement. I use technologies like HTML,
      CSS, SASS, Jekyll, JavaScript, jQuery, p5.js, and Photoshop to create my digital landscapes. I am currently learning
      React.js in order to build more powerful and elegant web applications. I dwell in the intersection of code and art
      in an attempt to understand a sliver of this world.
